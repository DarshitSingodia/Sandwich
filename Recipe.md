 In a mixing bowl take ⅓ cup grated carrots and ¼ cup finely chopped capsicum.
 Add one medium-sized potato, which has been boiled, peeled and chopped.
 Add ⅓ cup Veg Mayonnaise. 
  Add ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper and ¼ teaspoon mustard powder.
  Mix very well. For a slightly sweet taste, you can also add ¼ to ½ teaspoon sugar. If you want, you can also add some red chili flakes or some dried herbs like oregano, thyme, basil.
  Spread butter on the bread slices.
  Now spread the stuffing on the bread slices.
   Place on top the remaining buttered slices and slice the sandwich in rectangles or triangles or small squares. At this point, if you’d like, you can toast or grill these sandwiches.
   While serving the veg mayonnaise sandwiches you can garnish them with some grated carrots and grated cheddar cheese. Accompany them with some banana chips, potato chips or potato wedges.
